    "# Use FB Prophet for Time-series Forecasting: Six Group merchant trasactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Prophet is an open source library developed by Facebook which aims to make time-series forecasting easy and scalable. It is a type of a generalized additive model (GAM), which uses regression model with potentially non-linear smoothers. It is called additive because it addes multiple decomposed parts to explain some trends. For example, Prophet uses the following components: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + e(t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where,  \n",
    "$g(t)$: Growth. Big trend. Non-periodic changes.   \n",
    "$s(t)$: Sesonality. Periodic changes (e.g. weekly, yearly, etc.) represented by Fourier Series.  \n",
    "$h(t)$: Holiday effect that represents irregular schedules.   \n",
    "$e(t)$: Error. Any idiosyncratic changes not explained by the model. \n",
